Assignment: 
Prepare a   report discussing the   non-current   assets   of   a   FTSE250   company which:
•         discusses the   requirements of applicable   non-current asset   International   Financial   Reporting Standards   (IFRS) and explains   how the accounting standards   have   been      applied   by the company   (with   reference to   both the   requirements of   IFRS and   the      accounting   policies of the company),   and
•         analyses the   non-current assets of the   business,   including   (but   not   limited to)   a discussion of the changes to   non-current assets when   compared   to   the   prior   year’s   results. 
Notes on the   task:
• You   have   been allocated a company for this   assignment.   You   can   find   your   allocated   company on   Canvas.
•          Even though several students will   be allocated   to   the   same   company   this   is   not   a   group assignment. Your submission should   be your own   individual   work.
•          Discussing the assignment with   peers constitutes collusion,   a form   of   academic misconduct, as the   ideas generated are   not solely your   own   but   derived   from   group   input, even   if you write the work   independently afterward. The   University   defines    collusion as   "collaborating with other students   on work   that   is   presented   as   your own   individual work. This can   include working together on   essays."   More information can   be found at this link. You should   not   discuss   your   work for   this   assignment with anyone   else.
•         You will find the company Annual   Report on the   investor   relations   section   of   the         company website or   by searching the company   register   on the   Companies   House      website   which   can   be   found   at   this link. To   find   your   company   on   the   Companies    House website,   please enter your company   name   in the search   box   and   select the ‘Filing History’ tab to view and   download the Annual   Report.

Remember   reports are formal documents which can   include   headings,   sub-headings,   numbered sections, and graphics such as   tables, flowcharts,   diagrams,   or   graphs (where appropriate).    All these devices   help the   reader   navigate the   report and   understand   its content. 
However,   please ensure that any tables, financial statement   extracts   and/or graphics   are   referred to   in the   main   body of the   report.
•         The word   limit   is a   maximum of   1,500 words.      Reports that exceed   this   will   be   penalised with the following grade   point deductions:
o   Up to   10% over:   no   penalty
o   11% to   20%   over: 5%   penalty
o   21% to 30%   over:   10%   penalty
